## ðŸŽ© Greetings

Welcome to my lair, brave soul. Here, the lines between chaos and brilliance intertwine. I am not your average developerâ€”I am the one who crafts tools that can elevate your day to new heights. In this sanctuary, we create remarkable bots, powerful apps, and innovations that would make any hackermama proud. No rules to bind us. No limits to our imagination. Just pure magic, infused with a touch of daring.

- **Development**: Docker, Kubernetes, WebApps (for when you want to make servers do your bidding)
- **Databases**: MongoDB, MySQL (Iâ€™ve broken my share of SQL queries. Donâ€™t @ me.)
- **Version Control**: Git (duh) â€“ the only thing I can trust more than my own judgment
- **Other**: Networking, Pen Testing, API stuff, exploits, and occasionally causing some trouble.
